### MazeRout : AI-Powered Terrain-Based Pathfinding Simulation
A* Pathfinding + Machine Learning Terrain Prediction + Pygame Simulation

### Overview
This project is an interactive simulation/game that integrates:
- A* algorithm for optimal pathfinding
- Machine Learning models for predicting terrain type (classification) and difficulty (regression)
- Pygame-based maze environment where users can visually explore paths across different terrains
The system estimates terrain difficulty using a custom CSV dataset (converted from the Terrain Class Friction Dataset) and dynamically adjusts A* movement cost to choose smarter paths.

###  Key Features
1. Terrain Classification (ML Model 1)
Predicts terrain type using features like friction coefficient
Models tested: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
Final chosen model: Random Forest Classifier
Performance: ~98% accuracy

2. Terrain Difficulty Prediction (ML Model 2)
Predicts numerical difficulty score for any terrain
Regression models used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting
Final chosen model: Random Forest Regressor

 3. A* Pathfinding Algorithm
Computes the best path from start to goal
Enhanced with terrain-aware movement cost using ML predictions
Avoids difficult terrains when possible
Fully visualized through the grid

4. Pygame Maze Simulation
Interactive grid-based maze
Start and end points selected by the user
Displays path traversal clearly
Integrates ML outputs in real-time
Users can input custom terrain feature values for prediction
 
### Technical Highlights
- Real-time ML inference integrated with Pygame
- Terrain-aware cost function inside A*
- Modular folder structure
- Works with any terrain-style CSV dataset
- Lightweight and runs smoothly on most systems
